# Kickstarter_Challenge
Observing outcomes from theater kickstarter campaigns 

## OVERVIEW
  Tasked with analyzing and visualizing how different kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
    
    - We are specifically focusing in on play campaigns under the theater category.
    
    - We want to visualize outcomes by launch date as well as outcomes based on funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

  In order to successfully perform this analysis I gathered and validated the kickstarter data provided. I used a number of formulas in order to propperly format the data to meet our stakeholders needs. Then after having formatted the data, I used the pivot chart tool in excel to filter out the necessary fields that would allow me to see the outcomes of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns by month.
  Then in a separate sheet I used formulas such as COUNTIFS in order to gather the number of proejcts meeting the specific criteria that was required. This part was the most challenging mainly because there wasn't a way to speed this part of the analysis up. I also came across an error in my results but after correcting and validating it I was on my way.
  
  ## Results
  
  From our results in the first chart we can see that the number of successful campaigs began to rise in the first four months of the year but steadily declined after the month of May. Failed campaigns on the other hand were steady year round, and cancelled campaigns as well.

In the outcomes based on goals chart we can see that the percentage of successful campaings dropped the larger the goal funding amount was. The same relation can be seen for failed campaigs, the more funding they required the higher possibility there was for it to fail.

There were limitaitons to the data because I feel that a category or type of play would be real insightful and help us draw more conclusions from seeing what genre of play was successful and which weren't. Perhaps that field would be better to include in a similar analysis.
